# TRAGALDABAS-Kalman-Filter
  Code that simulates particle showers and reconstructs their tracks from 
their fingerprints on the TRAGALDABAS detector. This detector is composed 
by four plates/plans with 120 cells each one, capable of detect particles. 
By linking those fingerprints, we want to   reconstruct the initial track 
using Kalman Filter.

### GenerateTracks class
It generates ntrack tracks from a charged particle and propagates them in 
the Z axis direction through NPLAN planes.
#### GenerateTracks.digitization() method
It simulates the digital answer in NPLAN planes of detectors, in which:
- the coordinates (nx,ny) of the crossed pad are determined.
- the flight time is determined integrating tint.
### KalmanFilter class
It reconstructs the track through the GI Filter-
### Comments
Some coding criteria:
- The variable names, follow, in general, some mnemonic rules
- Names of vectors start with **v**
- Names of matrixes start with **m**
- Names of indices start with **i**
- Names of numbers start with **n**
